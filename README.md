# Java Chat
### University task
##### Java, Socket, JavaFX
#### Running
Just run it with IDE (Intelij and Java 13 used in source).
#### Description
It was ment to be Chat client, but I have never finished it due to time restrictions across all the projects.  
It is a static JavaFX window with some buttons, its here as a proof that I have been working (to some degree) with JavaFX.
#### Side Notes
Its a blank window with few buttons. Not really a chat.
